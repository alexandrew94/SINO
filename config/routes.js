// All of the three collections will be RESTful - restaurants, reviews and accounts. These will all be routed here.
// The registrations.js controller will handle all the RESTful actions of the user accounts (creating, editing, deleting accounts), whereas the sessions.js controller will only handle logging in (and cookies, presumably).

// Here are some ideas for routes
// '/restaurants' => GET the index of all the restaurants (INDEX)
// '/restaurants/new' => GET the page to make a new restaurant (NEW)
// '/restaurants/new' => POST creating a new restaurant (CREATE)
// '/restaurants/:id' => GET to show the current restaurant (SHOW)
// '/restaurants/:id/edit' => GET to edit an existing restaurant (EDIT)
// '/restaurants/:id/edit' => PUT to submit an edit of an existing restaurant (UPDATE)
// '/restaurants/:id/delete' => DELETE a restaurant (DELETE)
//
